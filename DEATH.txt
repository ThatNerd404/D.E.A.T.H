Big Project!!!:
I want to make an automatic task hud thing which whenever i ask it or whenever i boot up my computer it will give me useful information like
the time
random quote
system stats(ram usage, speed, etc.)
the weather
the temperature
my top five emails
other useful info...
it will also perform alot of other mundane tasks for me
like running bleachbit

Remember:
Make sure to read up on OOP (classes and stuff)
brush up on my webscrapping 
weather api on bookmark bar  
watch video and check how he check system stats
(pyqt5 has a time date thing so...)
learn about job scheduling and
asycn / multithreadin to run my programs automatically
first finish all the gui then add the functions 

Make:
a system to run my favorite stuff like firefox and vscode 
Package with classes for all the functions I want:
system stats DONE
gmail DONE
weather DONE
a quote DONE
Gui that looks cool:
use qt designer
Maybe autorun bleachbit
Main code to put it all to together:
import package and gui and get her done!

Also i will turn all of my projects to exe files so i can run them anywhere
and make icon and shortcut cause im cool like that
Notes:
MAKE BLUEPRINT IN POWERPOINT SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT 

when trying to run other programs put
subprocess.Popen(r'python project/you/want')
remember DRY
Don't Repeat Yourself!

remember when changing ui file to py use this command:
    pyuic5 fileuwanttochange.ui -o newnameforfile.py 

Pyqt5 already has something to make threads called qthreads 
and they also have qtime and qtdate i will check to make sure i dont need to make a thread for qtime or if it does it already

remember lambda is used so that you can add a parameter to functions 
tldr: add lambda: self.function(parameter) when you have a lot of code in a connect function 

GUI will have:
custom frame with yellow icons 
will have refresh function for getting new quotes
will say email not available 
I want 
will have tooltips for all the buttons for switching the page like email etc.
a black and yellow color palette
a sidebar for switching to the pages using a stacked widget
display system data with charts
color i like is #FAB005 yellow
